            <h3>Zhiwei Jiang</h3>
            <p><strong>Assistant Professor</strong></p>
            <p>
              Dr. Zhiwei Jiang completed his undergraduate studies at University College London, followed by a PhD in Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London in 2017. He then worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Imperial College and Queen Mary University of London. His research focuses on the design and fabrication of ultrathin, porous, and functionalized membranes for advanced separations, including reverse osmosis, hydrocarbon fractionation, and pharmaceutical enrichment.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022, he was awarded the prestigious Future Leaders Fellowship and began his current role as Head of Membrane Research at Exactmer Limited. He will join Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as an Assistant Professor in August 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Jiang has published his research as first or corresponding author in leading interdisciplinary journals, including Nature, Science, Nature Materials, and Advanced Materials.
